    "Java uses interfaces because it doesn't have multiple inheritance.\n",

    "Because Python has multiple inheritance, Python introduces a concept called mixin \n",
    "that encapsulates behavior that can be reused in other classes. \n",

    " - Inheritance means “is-a” and Mixin means “has-a”.\n",
